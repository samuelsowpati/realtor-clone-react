React was used for the frontend and FIRESTORE/FIREBASE was used as a database/backend

Queried the FIRESTORE database to fetch property listing according to user inputs(sale/rent, no. of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms, etc.)

Added a WISHLIST tab, to dynamically display favourited properties of users which are on discount

Created a secure CHAT application between owners and prospective buyers for price negotiation

Integrated a feature where tenants/customers can pay/purchase properties using the METAMASK wallet. And ensured secure transaction carryout via SOLIDITY Smart Contracts

Included a feature to view properties in the 360 degree view using PANOLENS

Used LEAFLET to display maps depicting the geographical location of the property

Used TailwindCSS to style the layout of the webpage
