PROPERTY MARKETPLACE USING REACT AND FIREBASE

React was used for the frontend and FIRESTORE/FIREBASE was used as a database/backend

Queried the FIRESTORE database to fetch property listing according to user inputs(sale/rent, no. of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms, etc.)

Added a WISHLIST tab, to dynamically display favourited properties of users which are on discount

Created a secure CHAT application between owners and prospective buyers for price negotiation

Integrated a feature where tenants/customers can pay/purchase properties using the METAMASK wallet. And ensured secure transaction carryout via SOLIDITY Smart Contracts

Included a feature to view properties in the 360 degree view using PANOLENS

Used LEAFLET to display 

Used TailwindCSS to style the layout of the webpage
